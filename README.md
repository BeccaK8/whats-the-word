# What's the Word?!

## Overview
What's the Word?! is a version of Wordle that gives you six chances to guess a mystery 5-letter word.  After each guess, you'll find out how close you are - letters in the correct spot will be green, letters in the word but in the wrong spot will be yellow, and letters not in the word at all will be white.  The shown keyboard will help you see what letters you haven't yet tried.  Can you figure out...What's the Word?! in time?? Good luck!

## Wireframes

Here is a wireframe of the game starting with an empty board, user entering the first word, and clicking "Guess"

This wireframe shows how the board will update as the user makes their first and second guesses

Here is a wireframe of the user guessing the correct word and winning!

Unfortunately, they may not guess the word every time so here's what will happen if they lose...

Finally, this is a wireframe of the user's statistics for the current session.

## Pseudocode

```js
// ===================================================== 
//  Define required constants:
//   - Master list of secret words
//   - Letter states: exact match, partial match, no match, unknown (not tried) with their associated background colors
//       = Exact Match ==> correct letter in the correct spot (green)
//       = Partial Match ==> correct letter in the wrong spot (yellow)
//       = No Match ==> letter not in secret word (grey)
//       = Unknown ==> letter has not been tried yet (white)
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
//  Identify and initialize state variables:
//   - Secret word
//   - Player object to hold stats
//   - Guesses array of arrays - store each letter separately to render easier
//   - Letters array - store current state of each letter
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Store elements that will be needed multiple times
//   - Guess button
//   - Play Again button
//   - Guess square divs
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Render the screen:
//   - Render the appropriate message (make a guess, you win, you lose)
//   - Render the guesses with the appropriate background color based on the guess's state (exact match, partial match, no match, unknown - not tried)
//   - Render the screen keyboard with the appropriate background color based on the letter's state (exact match, partial match, no match, unknown - not tried)
//   - Render the button: "GUESS" if user has more tries or "PLAY AGAIN" if they lost
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Click of Screen "Keyboard" Buttons:
//   - Check if "letter" button clicked - if not, ignore click
//   - Capture "letter" of button clicked
//   - Call Handle Selected Letter (below) with letter clicked
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Press of Keyboard
//   - Check if key pressed is a letter - if not, ignore press
//   - Capture "letter" of key pressed
//   - Call Handle Selected Letter (below) with letter pressed
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Selected Letter
//   - Update current guess square state variable with letter clicked
//   - Advance to next letter square on current guess
//   - If no more empty squares on current guess, highlight "GUESS" button
//   - Render changes to screen
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Click of "GUESS" button:
//   - Check for win - does guess equal mystery word
//   - If no win, for each letter in guess, 
//      = Check if letter at that spot is same as secret word at that spot.  If so, mark letter as "exact match"
//      = Check if letter at that spot is anywhere else in secret word.  If so, mark letter as "found but not exact match"
//      = Otherwise, mark letter as "not in secret word"
//   - Increment number of guesses
//   - If win or lose, update statistics
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Click of "PLAY AGAIN" button:
//   - Reinitialize game
// ===================================================== 

// ===================================================== 
// Handle Click of "Stats" button:
